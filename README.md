1. On page load, call the API to fetch a list of patients and display them in a table (example functions have been provided for you)
2. When a table row is clicked, show a separate view displaying the data for that patient. You can do this however you'd like, via another route or you can just display another panel below your table.
3. Don't worry too much about styling, but do make it look clean.
